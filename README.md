# ZBook G5 Hotkeys

Maps the HP ZBook Studio G5 Collaboration Keyboard keys to something more useful.

- Maps the calendar button (<kbd>Fn + F12</kbd>) to a sleep button.
- Maps the _share screen_ button to a _previous media_ button.
- Maps the _start call_ button to a _play/pause media_ button.
- Maps the _end call_ button to a _next media_ button.
- Maps <kbd>Shift + _end call_</kbd> to button for opening the audio settings. This is done to allow for easier disabling of the Band & Olufsen listening experience.
